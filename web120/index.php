 <p>My name is Vu The Tieu. As of now I am planning on getting my A.A. in science, 
 then transfer for my B.S. in Computer Science/Software Engineering. 
 My hobby is learning! It's more like something I enjoy than a hobby, although I do sometimes 
 go out of my way to learn something I feel would benefit me one way or another. </p>

 <p>I consider myself to be both an open-minded and stubborn person at the same time. 
 While I often seek to change or improve my worldview, if a model already exist for 
 certain concepts it's quite difficult to convince me otherwise but I am open and willing to 
 learn and understand someone else's point of view. It's because I am always very so slightly doubtful of 
 what I believe to be the truth.
